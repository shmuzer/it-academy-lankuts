Buzz Fit’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Buzz Fit’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Buzz Fit may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends, on the usage of its website. Buzz Fit also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on the Buzz Fit website. Buzz Fit only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below. Gathering of personally-identifying information, certain visitors to Buzz Fit’s website choose to interact with Buzz Fit, in ways that require Buzz Fit to gather personally-identifying information.

For example, we ask visitors who download the app to provide the physical address where the app will be playing.
